You don't have to tell the truth about it's status to other players. \n The top engine token shows the current status of the engine. \n Fix/Damage engine \n You can make action Repair/Damage on the engine in this room (using action card \"Repairs\" or \"Tools\" tool card): take both engine status tokens, check their values (do not inform other players about those values) and put them back in order chosen by yourself. \nYou don't have to tell the truth about if you have fixed the engine but you need to tell whether you have changed tokens order. \n You can repair/damage an engine even if there is a malfunction marker in the room, and even if you haven’t previously checked the engine status. \nNote! The ship has 3 engines, of which at least 2 must be functional in order to safely return to Earth. At the beginning of the game, players do not know which engines are working. \nPlayers can check the status of a given engine during the game – for example, here, in the appropriate Engine Room. At the end of the game, if the ship has not been destroyed earlier, all top engine tokens must be revealed to determine whether the ship exploded during the hyperspace jump attempt. \nNote! You cannot perform the \"Search\" action in this room. \n\n",
