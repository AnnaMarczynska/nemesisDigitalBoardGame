The Factory Pattern is not about "static" specifically —
it’s about delegating the creation logic of an object to a separate place (method or class) instead of calling new directly all over the codebase.

class with only static methods acts similarly:
It’s just a namespace of related functions that don’t depend on instance state.

Summary: static vs factory vs instance
Concept	            Meaning	                                        When to use
Instance method	    Operates on an existing object (this exists)	When behavior depends on that object’s data
Static method	    Belongs to the class, not an instance	        When you want utility or creation logic accessible without an object
Factory Pattern	    Centralized logic for object creation	        When new logic is repetitive, complex, or varies by type
